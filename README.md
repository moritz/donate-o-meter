Donate-O-Meter
==============

Show your visitors how long their donations sustain your website.

Background
----------

I have a website that a few dozen users heavily depend on, and i provide
it for free. But I have hosting costs, and my users are willing to help
me stem those costs. Those costs are also fairly predictable (monthly hosting
bills).

What Donate-O-Meter does
------------------------

Donate-O-Mater shows how long all the donations sustain the website, based
on the total amount of donations so far, and on predicted costs.


Features
--------

Donate-O-Meter supports different projects which are all stored in
the same database. For each project you can define recurring and one-time
transactions (a transaction is either a cost or revenue/donation).


Status
------

Very much a work in progress; not yet usable :-(

Technologies used
-----------------

* SQLite
* Perl 6
* Writes static JSON files (planned)
* integration into websites via included JS
